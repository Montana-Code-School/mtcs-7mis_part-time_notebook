Our first class!

## JavaScript Basics

We will be going over some JS basics, using the repo here: https://github.com/Montana-Code-School/JSBasics

## Introduce Yourself

This week, we want to know who you are and how the prework has been going. 

**Create a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website to introduce yourself.** You have all week to work on this, and we can present next Tuesday. It does not have to be fully functional or bug free, just focus on implementing what you know so far, and spend some time introducing yourself.

I hope some of you are ready to share cat pictures because I know I am.

## Standards

### File Structure

You will always want to keep all of your files organized properly. I would recommend you follow this structure while we work on basic projects. You can feel free to name the files and the project root as whatever you would like, but keep this structure:

```
My-Project-Folder (folder)

  img (folder)
    myImage.jpg

  css (folder)
    style.css

  js (folder)
    main.js

  index.html

```

"My-Project-Folder" is considered **the root project folder**, which is a term you will see often (I.E Navigate to your project root).

### Spaces vs Dashes

Along with this, I would like to see you all use dashes in folder and filenames, in place of
spaces. Spaces don't work as well when you are navigating using the command line. [You can find a great discussion about this over at Jeff Atwood's blog.](https://blog.codinghorror.com/of-spaces-underscores-and-dashes/)

### Previewing your Site

You can preview your site by dragging the html file into your browser, or right-clicking on it and selecting "Open With Chrome".

In OSX, you can also type `open index.html` within the project root folder to open it up in whatever your default browser is.
